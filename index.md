I have a PhD in Physics from [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/star) (2006), and have previously held positions at the [University of Leiden](http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl), Netherlands (2007-2010) and the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](http://www.mpia.de) in Heidelberg, Germany (2010-2013).
