I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in Astronomy Instrumentation in Oxford University's [Astrophysics group](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/astrophysics), and a Junior Research Fellow at [St Cross College](http://www.stx.ox.ac.uk), Oxford. In March 2016 I'm moving to the [Space Telescope Science Institute](http://www.stsci.edu) in Baltimore to join the [European Space Agency](http://www.esa.int) as an Instrument Scientists for the James Webb Space Telescope.

I have a PhD in Physics from [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/star) (2006), and have previously held positions at the [University of Leiden](http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl), Netherlands (2007-2010) and the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](http://www.mpia.de) in Heidelberg, Germany (2010-2013).

For more details, [here's my CV (pdf)](./files/kendrew_cv_web.pdf). 

Looking for my blog? I retired it in mid-2015. If you're looking for any particular content, [email me](/contact/). A more minimal new blog is [here](/notes/).
