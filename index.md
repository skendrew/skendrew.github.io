I'm an Astronomer and Instrument Scientist working for the [European Space Agency](http://www.esa.int) in Baltimore, MD, as member of the [James Webb Space Telescope](http://sci.esa.int/jwst/) (JWST) mission office. JWST is a major next-generation infrared space telescope to be launched in 2018, built as a collaboration between the US, European and Canadian Space Agencies (NASA/ESA/CSA). I specifically work on JWST's mid-infrared instrument MIRI, and have been a member of the European MIRI consortium since 2007.

I have a PhD in Physics from [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/star) (2006), and have previously held positions at the [University of Leiden](http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl), Netherlands (2007-2010), the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](http://www.mpia.de) in Heidelberg, Germany (2010-2013), and the [University of Oxford](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/astrophysics), UK (2013-2016).

Looking for my blog? I retired it in mid-2015. If you're looking for any particular content, [email me](/contact/). A more minimal new blog is [here](/notes/).
