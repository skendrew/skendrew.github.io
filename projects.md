## Current Projects

* [HARMONI](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/visible-and-infrared-instruments/harmoni) is one of 2 first-light instruments for the European Extremely Large Telescope, led by the University of Oxford and the UK Astronomy Technology Centre. It will provide integral field spectroscopy at visible and near-infrared wavelengths at a range of spatial and spectral resolutions. At Oxford I am investigating the performance of HARMONI in the field of galaxy evolution at high redshifts.

* [MIRI](http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/instruments/miri) is the Mid-Infrared Instrument for the [James Webb Space Telescope](http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/) (JWST), a joint [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov)-[ESA](http://www.esa.int)-[CSA](http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/) mission due for launch in 2018. I've been a member of the MIRI test, calibration and science team since 2007, and am a lead scientist for MIRI's Low Resolution Spectrograph.

* High mass star formation across the Milky Way Galaxy. My astrophysical interest is in the study of high mass star formation in the Milky Way Galaxy (and beyond!). I'm particularly interested in studying how star formation is regulated on galactic scales and in extreme environments such as the Central Molecular Zone. For some of my work I use citizen science data from the [Milky Way Project](http://www.milkywayproject.org) by the [Zooniverse](http://www.zooniverse.org).
