## Current Projects


* [MIRI](http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/instruments/miri) is the Mid-Infrared Instrument for the [James Webb Space Telescope](http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/) (JWST), a joint [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov)-[ESA](http://www.esa.int)-[CSA](http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/) mission due for launch in 2018. I've been a member of the MIRI test, calibration and science team since 2007, and am a lead scientist for MIRI's Low Resolution Spectrograph; in March 2016 I joined the European Space Agency's JWST team at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, MD, to work on MIRI full-time.

* Simulated observations of high-z galaxies with future observatories and instruments. At Oxford I developed code to convert output from cosmological simulations into 3-D spectral cubes in order to carry out mock observations with the HARMONI integral field spectrograph simulator HSIM (see [Kendrew et al 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06983)). I'm hoping to extend this work with better code, more physics and different types of simulated observations.

* High mass star formation across the Milky Way Galaxy. My astrophysical interest is in the study of high mass star formation in the Milky Way Galaxy (and beyond!). I'm particularly interested in studying how star formation is regulated on galactic scales and in extreme environments such as the Central Molecular Zone. For some of my work I use citizen science data from the [Milky Way Project](http://www.milkywayproject.org) by the [Zooniverse](http://www.zooniverse.org).
