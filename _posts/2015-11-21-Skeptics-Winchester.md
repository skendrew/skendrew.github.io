Next Thursday, 26 November 2015, I'm the speaker at [Skeptics in the Pub](http://winchester.skepticsinthepub.org/), Winchester. I'll be giving a talk about the [James Webb Space Telescope](http://jwst.nasa.gov), its history, science goals and technology. 

As I'm entering my last few months in Oxford and the UK, I'm having to turn down lots of invitations to speak in the coming months. Moving across the Atlantic is becoming very real!
