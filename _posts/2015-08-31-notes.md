I kept a blog for many years called One Small Step, where I wrote about new results in astrophysics, my own work, and community and cultural issues in our field. I felt it didn't really reflect what I wanted to write about very well anymore, so I closed it down earlier this year.

As I enjoy writing, I created this page where I will continue to post bits of news and thoughts.
