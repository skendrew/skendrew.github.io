It’s okay to trade the possibility of your 80s and 90s for more guaranteed fun in your 20s and 30s.

The best public restrooms are in hotels: The St. Regis in New York, Claridge’s in London, The Fullerton in Singapore, to name a few.

Never stay out after midnight three nights in a row … unless something really good comes up on the third night.

You will regret your tattoos.

Never date an ex of your friend.

Join Twitter; become your own curator of information.

If riding the bus doesn't incentivize you to improve your station in life, nothing will.

Time is too short to do your own laundry.  

When the bartender asks, you should already know what you want to drink.

You don’t have to like football, but you should understand the offside rule.

When people don’t invite you to a party, you really shouldn’t go.  And sometimes even when you are invited, you shouldn’t go.   

When in doubt, always kiss the girl.

Tip more than you should.

You probably use your cell phone too often and at the wrong moments. 

Buy expensive sunglasses.  Superficial? Yes, but so are the men judging you. And it tells these men you appreciate nice things and are responsible enough not to lose them.

Learn to do a push up. 

A glass of wine or two with lunch will not ruin your day. 

Find a hair stylist who gets you and maintain the relationship. Tip generously.

No selfies

There’s always another level. Just be content knowing that you are still better off than most who have ever lived.

You can get away with a lot more if you're the one buying the drinks.

Ask for fries instead of a salad.

Always offer to split a check.

Find a good cobbler and keep your damn heels in good shape

Eat alone at a bar.

Cobblers will save your shoes. So will shoe trees.

When a bartender buys you a round, tip double.   

The cliché is that having money is about not wasting time. But in reality, money is about facilitating spontaneity.

Be spontaneous.

Piercings are liabilities in fights.  

Decide what amount of hair you want to remove, and own the rest with pride

Convince him to order dessert and eat half

One girlfriend at a time is probably enough. Especially if you already have a boyfriend too.

#StopItWithTheHastags

Your ties should be rolled and placed in a sectioned tie drawer.  

Throw parties.  But have someone else clean up the next day.

You may only request one song from the DJ and it should only ever be Candi Staton.  

Measure yourself only against your previous self.

Take more pictures.  With a camera.

Place-dropping is worse than name-dropping. 

When you admire the work of artists or writers, tell them.  And spend money to acquire their work.  

Your clothes do not match. They go together.  

Staying angry is a waste of energy. 

Revenge can be a good way of getting over anger.   

If she expects the person you are 20% of the time, 100% of the time, then she doesn't want you.

Always bring a bottle of something to the party.  

Avoid that “last” whiskey. You’ve probably had enough.  

If you are wittier than you are handsome, avoid loud clubs.  

Drink outdoors.  And during the day.  And sometimes by yourself.

Date women. You’ll be surprised. 

If it’s got velvet ropes and lines, walk away unless you know someone.  

You cannot have a love affair with whiskey because whiskey will never love you back. 

Feigning unpretentiousness is worse than being pretentious. 

The New Yorker is not high-brow. Neither is The Economist.  

If you believe in evolution, you should know something about how it works.

No-one cares if you are offended, so stop it.  

Never take an ex back. She tried to do better and is settling with you.

Eating out alone can be magnificent. Find a place where you can sit at the bar.

Read more. It allows you to borrow someone else’s brain, and will make you more interesting at a dinner party – provided that you don’t initiate conversation with, “So, who are you reading …”

Ignore the boos. They usually come from the cheap seats.

Don’t gamble if losing $100 is going to piss you off.

Remember, “rules are for the obedience of fools and the guidance of wise men.”
