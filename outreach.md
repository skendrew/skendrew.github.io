I believe science and scientists should play an important role in society, and I'm interested in finding new ways for astronomers to engage with a broader public, within or outside of the scientific research community. Here's a few things I've been involved with.

## Astronomy Hack Days and .Astronomy

The [.Astronomy](http://www.dotastronomy.com) conferences, led by Oxford astronomer and TED Fellow [Dr. Rob Simpson](http://www.twitter.com/orbitingfrog), bring together scientists and educators to share ideas and collaborate on innovative computing projects for astronomy to leverage the immense potential of modern computers and the web. Over the years .Astronomy has created a growing community of astronomers who think and work creatively on new ways of exploiting the web for science. I organised the 2009 and 2012 instalments of .Astronomy, and in 2014 I hosted a [software hack day](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1278) at the [SPIE](http://www.spie.org) conference on Astronomical Telescopes & Instrumentation in Montreal.

## Citizen Science

The [Zooniverse](http://www.zooniverse.org) group, based in Oxford and Chicago and led by [Dr. Chris Lintott](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lintott), have created a suite of citizen science projects in areas from astrophysics to ancient Egyptian papyrology. I'm a member of the science team for the [Milky Way Project](http://www.milkywayproject.org), which aims to study star formation in the plane of our Galaxy using survey images from the Spitzer Space Telescope. By gathering data on the images from thousands of volunteers, we can perform [statistical studies](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5486) of galactic star formation, and use our volunteers' data to [train machine learning algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2692). Citizen science provides a unique avenue for the research community to engage with thousands of keen enthusiasts around the world.

## Public talks, Outreach and Media

I've given many public talks about my all aspects of my work to a variety of audiences, and invariably enjoy these events. I write about astronomy and research online, some of my writing has appeared in [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk), and I've appeared on tv and radio to talk about my work and interests. 

If you'd like me to give a talk about any of the projects I work on, or on any of the science & society issues I care about, please [get in touch](/contact/). You don't have to pay me a fee (though I won't turn one down), but if there's travel involved I'd appreciate you covering that expense.
